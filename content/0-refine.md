The original creator [David Huynh](http://web.archive.org/web/20141021040915/http://davidhuynh.net/spaces/nicar2011/tutorial.pdf){:target="_blank"} said Refine is:

#### "A power tool for working with messy data"

- more powerful than a spreadsheet
- more interactive and visual than scripting
- more provisional / exploratory / experimental / playful than a database

{% capture usecase %}
**Explore** - navigate and evaluate quality with visualizations and filters that help dig deeply into the data so you can get to know it better...

**Clean** - efficiently discover and fix inconsistency with faceting, clustering, cell transforms, GREL expressions...

**Transform** - easily change formats, subset, or reshape with split/join multi valued cells, split columns, transpose columns/rows...

**Extend** - enrich data by combining files, merging projects, fetching URLs, reconciliation with online databases...

**Automate** - record and preserve your processing routine for transparency, then automate reuse by exporting operation history in JSON!
