## Getting Started with OpenRefine: Explore, Clean, and Transform your Data!

Before analysis comes the messy work of evaluating, cleaning, and transforming data.
This hands on workshop will introduce a free power tool to get the job done: [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/index.html). 
We will install Refine, create a project, and get oriented to the many features for exploring and transforming tabular data. 

Intended for students, faculty, and staff with an interest in cleaning, transforming, and working with diverse data sources. 
No experience necessary.
